# NTTdata x LUISS University

The project was assigned by NTTData for the Machine Learning course.
The data was collected handling 8 different data sets provided by NTTData regarding the AS-IS process, from order creation to customer review for a seller company operating in the E-COMMERCE market.

The main goal of the business case is to increase profitability by performing the customer analysis identifying groups of users with similar purchasing behaviors in order to create a marketing strategy towards each target. 

After achieving this goal, the next steps concern the recommendation System able to provide to each user a set of products related to their interests, in order to maximize the probability of purchase. And at least, the delivery time prediction is performed through the shipping time analysis to predict an accurate date of delivery and to reduce delays, in order to improve the quality of the shipping service. 

In order to achieve these 3 main goals, it is necessary to manage customer care and sales in order to strategically place the company over competitors but also taking into account the customer needs acting as a bridge between the business activity and the external environment to ensures customer satisfaction.
